# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a tic-tac-toe game in Java.

1. When the application loads, only the game board should be displayed 

2. When a user clicks within the game board (in an empty space) their mark (either "X" or "O" should appear there). "X" goes first. So the first valid click on the game board should produce an "X". 
The second should produce an "O", and then they should trade off.

 3. The "X" s should be red, and the "O"s should be black.

4. If someone wins (gets three in a row), you should make an alert/dialog box appear on the screen that says either "X has won!" or "O has won!" 
And when the dialog box is closed, the game should be reset to its beginning state.

5. If all the areas of the board get filled but nobody wins, a dialog box appear on the screen that says either "Cats game!" 
And when the dialog box is closed, the game should be reset to its beginning state.
